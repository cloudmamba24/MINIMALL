# üî• **SHOPIFY INSIDER SETUP GUIDE**

*The real process that actually works - no BS, just the cheat codes*

---

## üéØ **THE FULL SHOPIFY DEVELOPER SETUP PROCESS**

### **PHASE 1: Partner Dashboard Setup** 
**üîó URL:** `https://partners.shopify.com/`

#### **Step 1: Create Partner Account**
```bash
# üîë INSIDER TIP: Use a business email, not Gmail
# Shopify flags personal emails for manual review
```

1. **Sign up** at partners.shopify.com
2. **Choose "Build apps"** (not "Sell themes")
3. **Business Info:** Use real business details
4. **Tax Info:** You'll need this for payouts later

#### **Step 2: Create Your App** 
1. **Dashboard** ‚Üí **Apps** ‚Üí **Create App**
2. **App Type:** Choose **"Public App"** (for App Store)
   - *Or "Custom App" for private use*
3. **App Name:** "MiniMall" (or whatever you want)
4. **App URL:** `https://admin.yourdomain.com`
5. **Allowed Redirection URLs:** 
   ```
   https://admin.yourdomain.com/api/auth/shopify/callback
   ```

### **PHASE 2: App Configuration** 

#### **Critical Settings in Partner Dashboard:**

**üîê App Setup Tab:**
- **App URL:** `https://admin.yourdomain.com`
- **Allowed redirection URLs:** `https://admin.yourdomain.com/api/auth/shopify/callback`
- **Webhooks:** `https://admin.yourdomain.com/api/webhooks/`

**üîë App Credentials (SAVE THESE!):**
```env
SHOPIFY_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
SHOPIFY_API_SECRET=your_api_secret_here
```

**üìã Required Scopes:** (Add these in Partner Dashboard)
```
read_products
write_products

```

---

### **PHASE 3: Shopify CLI Setup** 

#### **Install Shopify CLI:**
```bash
npm install -g @shopify/cli @shopify/theme
```

#### **üîë CHEAT CODE: Skip the CLI bullshit**
Most tutorials make you use Shopify CLI for everything. **You don't need it** if you:
1. Manually configure your Partner Dashboard (above)
2. Deploy to your own domains (Vercel)
3. Handle OAuth yourself (which you already do)

**CLI is only needed for:**
- Theme development
- GraphiQL debugging
- Shopify Functions (advanced)

---

### **PHASE 4: Testing Your App**

#### **Step 1: Create Development Store**
1. **Partner Dashboard** ‚Üí **Stores** ‚Üí **Create development store**
2. **Purpose:** "Test my app"
3. **Store type:** "Development store"

#### **Step 2: Install Your App**
1. **Partner Dashboard** ‚Üí **Apps** ‚Üí **[Your App]** ‚Üí **Test on development store**
2. **OR** navigate to: `https://your-dev-store.myshopify.com/admin/apps`
3. **Install** your app

#### **üîë INSIDER SECRET:**
Your app's install URL format:
```
https://{shop}.myshopify.com/admin/oauth/authorize?client_id={api_key}&scope={scopes}&redirect_uri={redirect_url}
```

---

### **PHASE 5: Going Live (Production)**

#### **Requirements for App Store:**
1. **App must be public** (not development)
2. **Privacy policy** required
3. **GDPR compliance** required  
4. **Support email** required
5. **App listing** with screenshots

#### **üî• CHEAT CODE: Skip App Store Initially**
You can distribute privately by:
1. Sharing your app's install URL directly
2. Adding specific stores to your "Development stores" list
3. No App Store approval needed!
