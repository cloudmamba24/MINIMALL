## Scroll & Viewport Behavior

### Sticky Elements

#### Panel Headers & Footers
- **Location**: Product details and cart side panels
- **Behavior**: Header (containing title and close button) and footer (containing total and checkout button) remain fixed at top and bottom of panel
- **Content Scrolling**: Middle content section scrolls independently between sticky header/footer
- **Implementation**: `position: sticky; top: 0;` for header, `position: sticky; bottom: 0;` for footer

#### Main Navigation
- **Behavior**: Primary navigation elements remain accessible during scroll
- **Method**: Natural scroll behavior without artificial stickiness

### Scroll-Triggered Animations

#### Logo Separation Effect
- **Primary Example**: "GREAT STORE" logo animation on main landing page
- **Control Method**: State entirely dependent on vertical scroll position
- **Calculation**: Direct mapping of scroll offset to transform values
- **Performance**: Uses `transform` properties for GPU acceleration

#### Content Reveal
- **Method**: Elements animate into view as they enter viewport
- **Trigger**: Intersection Observer API for performance
- **Timing**: Staggered reveals for lists, immediate for single elements

### Scroll Behavior Patterns

#### Native Smooth Scroll
- **Usage**: In-page anchor links (e.g., clicking "LOOKBOOK")
- **Implementation**: `scroll-behavior: smooth;` or `scrollIntoView({ behavior: 'smooth' })`
- **Performance**: Leverages browser optimization

#### Custom Scroll Effects
- **Logo Animation**: Custom implementation tied to scroll position
- **Parallax Elements**: Subtle background movement on scroll
- **Performance Considerations**: Uses `requestAnimationFrame` for smooth updates

## Page Transitions

### SPA-Style Navigation

#### In-Page Navigation
- **Behavior**: Initial "link-in-bio" page acts like Single-Page Application
- **Method**: Navigation triggers smooth scroll to page sections rather than full refresh
- **Examples**: Clicking "SHOP" or "LOOKBOOK" navigation items
- **Benefits**: Maintains state, faster perceived performance

#### Content Loading
- **Method**: Dynamic content loading without page refresh
- **Animation**: Content fades in as it becomes available
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation to standard navigation

### Full Page Navigation

#### External Navigation
- **Trigger**: Navigating from link-in-bio page to full site
- **Example**: Clicking "Discover Lookbook" button
- **Transition Sequence**:
  1. Brief solid black screen (~100ms)
  2. Fade-in of new page content from black (~500ms)
  
```json
{
  "name": "FullPageTransition",
  "sequence": [
    {
      "phase": "exit",
      "effect": "fade to black",
      "duration_ms": 100,
      "background": "#000000"
    },
    {
      "phase": "enter",
      "effect": "fade from black",
      "duration_ms": 500,
      "easing": "ease-out"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Browser Navigation
- **Back Button**: Instant transition with no custom animation
- **Forward Button**: Standard browser behavior
- **Refresh**: Standard page load without custom transitions

## Media Behavior

### Image Loading & Display

#### Lazy Loading Implementation
```json
{
  "name": "ImageLazyLoad",
  "trigger": "Image enters viewport",
  "effect": "Product images fade in smoothly as user scrolls. Before loading, space shows solid neutral-colored block.",
  "duration_ms": 300,
  "easing": "ease-in-out",
  "implementation": {
    "placeholder": "background-color: #f5f5f5;",
    "loading": "opacity: 0 to 1 transition",
    "intersection_threshold": 0.1
  },
  "notes": "Improves perceived performance and reduces bandwidth usage."
}
```

#### Image Hover Effects
- **Type**: Static overlay changes only
- **No Animations**: No hover-to-preview video or GIF content
- **Consistency**: All image hovers follow same overlay pattern

#### Video Content
- **Observation**: No video content present in user journey
- **Implementation Note**: Video patterns would likely follow same fade-in/overlay principles

### Content Loading States

#### Skeleton Loading
- **Usage**: Product grids during filtering or loading
- **Animation**: Subtle pulse effect on placeholder elements
- **Duration**: Continues until content loads

#### Progressive Enhancement
- **Method**: Content loads in layers (structure → styling → interactions)
- **Fallbacks**: Basic functionality available during loading

## Microinteractions & Feedback

### Button Interactions

#### Hover States
```json
{
  "name": "ButtonHover",
  "trigger": "Hover on primary CTA buttons",
  "effect": "Button background darkens",
  "duration_ms": 150,
  "easing": "ease-out",
  "implementation": {
    "property": "background-color",
    "from": "#111111",
    "to": "#000000"
  },
  "notes": "Quick transition maintains responsive feel."
}
```

#### Active States
- **Duration**: Immediate feedback (0ms)
- **Visual Change**: Slight depression or color inversion
- **Reset**: Returns to hover state on release

### Form Element Selection

#### Size Button Selection
```json
{
  "name": "SizeButtonSelection",
  "trigger": "Click size button",
  "effect": "Selected button background becomes solid black, text turns white",
  "duration_ms": 0,
  "easing": "instant",
  "implementation": {
    "selected_bg": "#111111",
    "selected_text": "#FFFFFF",
    "unselected_bg": "transparent",
    "unselected_text": "#111111",
    "border": "1px solid #111111"
  },
  "notes": "Instant switch provides immediate, persistent feedback. No transition animation for clarity of selection state."
}
```

#### Quantity Selector
- **Buttons**: + and - buttons without distinct hover states
- **Feedback**: Quantity number updates instantly on click
- **Visual**: Number change is immediate, no counting animation

### Loading States

#### Add to Cart Loading
```json
{
  "name": "AddToCartLoading",
  "trigger": "Click 'Add to Cart' button",
  "states": [
    {
      "name": "default",
      "text": "Add to Cart",
      "background": "#111111"
    },
    {
      "name": "loading",
      "text": "Adding...",
      "background": "#666666",
      "spinner": true
    },
    {
      "name": "success",
      "text": "Added!",
      "background": "#16A34A",
      "duration_ms": 1000
    }
  ]
}
```

## Timing & Staging

### Interaction Speed Categories

#### Immediate Feedback (0-50ms)
- Form element selection
- Button active states
- Input focus changes

#### Quick Response (50-200ms)
- Hover effects
- Color changes
- Small UI element updates

#### Smooth Transitions (200-400ms)
- Panel slides
- Image cross-fades
- Content reveals

#### Dramatic Effects (400ms+)
- Full page transitions
- Large content area changes
- Complex multi-step animations

### Animation Staging

#### Sequential Animations
- **Panel Replacement**: Product panel exit immediately followed by cart panel enter
- **Multi-step Processes**: Loading → Success → Return to default state

#### Parallel Animations
- **Image Cross-fade**: Simultaneous fade-out/fade-in of product images
- **Overlay Effects**: Text and background overlay animate together

#### Staggered Animations
- **Not Observed**: No staggered list animations in current implementation
- **Opportunity**: Could be used for product grid loading

### Performance Considerations

#### GPU Acceleration
- **Properties Used**: `transform`, `opacity` for hardware acceleration
- **Avoidance**: Layout-triggering properties during animations

#### Animation Cleanup
- **Method**: Remove event listeners and clear intervals after animations complete
- **Memory**: Prevent memory leaks from abandoned animations

## Visual Context & Feel

### Animation Philosophy

#### Principles
- **Minimal & Functional**: Motion serves purpose, not decoration
- **Purposeful**: Animations guide user flow and reveal information on demand
- **Clean**: No unnecessary flourishes or distracting effects

#### Brand Alignment
- **Sophistication**: Smooth, polished interactions reflect premium brand
- **Restraint**: Animations don't overwhelm content
- **Consistency**: Predictable motion language throughout experience

### Speed Profile

#### Responsiveness Characteristics
- **Instant Feedback**: Interface reacts immediately to user input
- **Quick Completion**: Short animation durations prevent lag feeling
- **Snappy Feel**: Overall experience feels fast and responsive

#### User Experience Impact
- **Trust**: Immediate feedback builds confidence in interface
- **Flow**: Smooth transitions maintain user engagement
- **Efficiency**: Quick animations don't impede task completion

### Consistency Framework

#### Motion Patterns
- **Panel Behavior**: All panels slide from right with consistent timing
- **Overlay Effects**: All hover states use same fade-in overlay pattern
- **Transitions**: Consistent easing curves throughout experience

#### Predictability Benefits
- **Learning**: Users quickly understand interaction patterns
- **Efficiency**: Reduced cognitive load through consistent behaviors
- **Trust**: Reliable interactions build user confidence

## Accessibility & Motion Sensitivity

### Focus Management

#### Keyboard Navigation
- **Focus Indicators**: Standard browser focus outlines present

- **Tab Order**: Logical progression through interactive elements

#### State Communication
- **Selection Clarity**: Size selection provides clear, persistent visual feedback
- **Screen Reader Support**: State changes announced appropriately
- **High Contrast**: Selected states maintain sufficient contrast

### Motion Sensitivity Considerations

#### Scroll-Bound Animation
- **Primary Concern**: Logo separation animation most significant motion effect
- **User Control**: Animation directly controlled by user scroll
- **Mitigation**: Should implement `prefers-reduced-motion` media query

```css
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  .logo-animation {
    transform: none !important;
  }
  
  .transition-elements {
    transition-duration: 0.01ms !important;
  }
}
```

#### Animation Alternatives
- **Reduced Motion**: Instant state changes instead of transitions
- **User Preference**: Respect system-level motion settings
- **Essential Motion**: Maintain only functionally necessary animations

### Implementation Recommendations

#### Motion Settings
- **Default**: Full animation experience for users who haven't expressed preference
- **Reduced**: Simplified animations that maintain functionality
- **Testing**: Verify experience with motion preferences enabled

#### Performance Monitoring
- **Frame Rate**: Monitor for 60fps during animations
- **Battery Impact**: Consider reducing animations on low-power devices
- **User Feedback**: Provide options to customize motion preferences
