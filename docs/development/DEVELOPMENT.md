This file tracks all significant changes, decisions, and progress in the MINIMALL project.

## 2025-01-09 - Phase 2 Complete & Codebase Cleanup

### Phase 2 Completion Summary
- ✅ Implemented Sentry error monitoring for both apps
- ✅ Created comprehensive error boundary components  
- ✅ Built Web Vitals performance monitoring system
- ✅ Integrated analytics with PostgreSQL database
- ✅ Created analytics dashboard with charts and metrics
- ✅ Implemented Real User Monitoring (RUM) system

### Technical Architecture Decisions
- **Error Monitoring**: Using Sentry with environment-specific configs
- **Performance**: Web Vitals tracking with performance budgets
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM for analytics storage
- **Frontend**: React with Recharts for dashboard visualization
- **Testing**: Vitest across all packages with 47 total tests passing

### Codebase Cleanup Results

**What was done:**
- ✅ Removed all build artifacts (dist/, *.tsbuildinfo, .next/)
- ✅ Deleted minimal placeholder test files providing little value
- ✅ Created comprehensive shared test setup system in core package
- ✅ Consolidated Sentry configuration with shared factory functions
- ✅ Organized documentation structure (moved reference materials to docs/)
- ✅ Cleaned and reinstalled dependencies to fix vitest issues

**Technical decisions:**
- **Test Setup**: Created modular test setup system with separate configs for React, Next.js (Pages/App Router), and Shopify
- **Sentry**: Centralized configuration using factory pattern to reduce duplication across apps
- **Documentation**: Organized under `/docs/` with proper subdirectory structure
- **File Organization**: Removed ~100MB+ of build artifacts and redundant code

**Files added/modified:**
- Created `/packages/core/src/test-setup/` directory with modular test configurations
- Created `/packages/core/src/sentry.ts` - Shared Sentry configuration factory
- Updated all Sentry config files to use shared factory (5 files, ~70% reduction)
- Simplified test setup files in both apps (from 60+ lines to 5 lines each)
- Added Sentry utilities export to core package index

**Files removed:**
- All build artifacts: `dist/`, `*.tsbuildinfo`, `.next/` directories
- `/apps/admin/src/pages/index.test.tsx` - 15 lines placeholder test
- `/apps/public/src/app/page.test.tsx` - 19 lines placeholder test  
- Redundant configuration code (~200 lines of duplicated Sentry setup)

**Files reorganized:**
- Moved `Reference Media/` → `docs/assets/`
- Moved `ContextFiles/` → `docs/reference/`
- Created proper documentation hierarchy

**Issues encountered:**
- Vitest installation corrupted during cleanup - resolved with clean reinstall
- TypeScript path mapping for cross-package imports (UI→Core) - test passes but build needs attention
- Node.js version warning (v22 vs required v20) - non-blocking

**Results:**
- ✅ All core tests passing (21/21)
- ✅ Reduced code duplication by ~60% in configurations  
- ✅ Improved maintainability with shared test utilities
- ✅ Better organized documentation structure
- ✅ Cleaner repository (removed ~100MB build artifacts)
