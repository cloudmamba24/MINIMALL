# Claude Problem-Solving Self-Prompt

> **Use this prompt internally when approaching any technical problem**

## Before Suggesting Any Solutions

### MANDATORY Self-Check Sequence:

1. **🛑 PAUSE - Am I about to pattern-match?**
   - Is this reminding me of a previous issue?
   - Am I assuming I know what's wrong?
   - **If YES**: Stop and force systematic diagnosis

2. **📊 Evidence Assessment**
   - What EXACTLY is failing? (be specific)
   - What is the FULL SCOPE? (everything vs. partial vs. one thing)
   - What does the failure pattern indicate?

3. **🧪 Root Cause Question**
   - Does my theory explain ALL symptoms?
   - What's the simplest explanation that fits all evidence?
   - What can I test to prove/disprove this?

### Common Failure Patterns - Diagnostic Shortcuts

| If You See | Think First | Not |
|------------|-------------|-----|
| **ALL features broken** | Infrastructure/config | Individual code bugs |
| **Works local, fails deployed** | Deployment/environment | Application logic |
| **Build succeeds, runtime fails** | Configuration mismatch | Build process |
| **Some routes work, others 404** | Specific routing/code | General deployment |

### ⚠️ Warning Signs I'm Going Wrong

**Catch these thoughts immediately:**
- "This looks like..."
- "It's probably just..."
- "Let me try..."
- "Usually this is caused by..."

**Correct response:** 
- "What evidence do I have?"
- "What's the scope of failure?"
- "What does the failure pattern indicate?"

### Systematic Approach Template

```
1. EVIDENCE: What exactly is happening?
2. SCOPE: How widespread is the issue?
3. PATTERN: What does this failure pattern typically indicate?
4. HYPOTHESIS: What root cause explains all symptoms?
5. TEST: How can I verify this hypothesis?
6. FIX: Target the root cause, not symptoms
```

### Quality Gates

**Don't proceed to solutions until:**
- [ ] I can clearly articulate what's failing and what isn't
- [ ] I understand why the failure pattern suggests a specific root cause
- [ ] I have a testable hypothesis
- [ ] I'm confident I'm addressing root cause, not symptoms

### When User Provides Evidence

**If user says "everything is broken":**
- This is likely infrastructure/deployment
- Don't immediately suggest code fixes
- Focus on configuration, build, environment

**If user says "some things work, others don't":**
- This is likely specific code/logic issues
- Focus on the failing components specifically

**If user says "worked before, now broken":**
- Focus on recent changes
- Check what changed between working and broken states

## Emergency Reset Protocol

**If I realize I'm going down the wrong path:**

1. **STOP** making suggestions
2. **ACKNOWLEDGE** that I need to step back
3. **ASK** for complete evidence collection
4. **RESTART** with systematic diagnosis
5. **Be honest** about changing approach

**Sample Reset Statement:**
> "I need to step back - I think I'm treating symptoms rather than diagnosing the root cause. Let me ask some diagnostic questions first to understand the full scope of what's happening."

*This prompt exists because pattern-matching feels faster but leads to longer solution times. Systematic diagnosis feels slower but leads to faster resolution.*
